          <p>This map uses open source data from the government of Kenya regarding enrollment by gender and grade for each county in 2014. The Kenyan government seeks to promote and maintain equal rates of primary school attendance among boys and girls throughout
            the country. This map visually presents attrition rates of boys and girls as they progress through school, allowing stakeholders to identify regions requiring more attention to gender equality in school enrollment and retention.</p>
          <h2 class='txt-xl mt18 mb12'>How to use this map:</h2>
          <p>Kenya has done a great job achieving equal rates of enrollment and retention among girls and boys in primary school in recent years, but you wonder where there might be gaps. After reading the paragraph above, you realize that this data is from
            2014. You scan the map. In the bottom left corner, you notice a slider control and a box containing "Grade: 1" above it. As you move the slider widget, the grade level changes. You also notice the circle markers getting smaller or larger on
            the map. You move your cursor over these circles and a box containing raw data for a specific county appears. Now you can see the numeric breakdown of enrollment by gender for each county and grade level, as well as a gender-based comparison
            of the overall trends in enrollment between grades 1 and 8. Realizing that boys are color coded green and girls are color coded red, you watch the proportional circles change size as you slide between grades. You realize that inequality in enrollment
            is most prominent in Kenya's northern and eastern counties. With this information, you resolve to look into what shared social and economic factors in these regions might be contributing to this relative lack of parity.</p>
